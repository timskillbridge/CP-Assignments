# Top Ten

## Summary
There are over 110 different HTML tags, and at LEAST over 120 CSS properties! Will we be learning them ALL?! 

No. However, this challenge will get you started!

### Explore HTML
Spend some time reviewing your favorite websites - what HTML is being used to make them? Peruse [HTMLreference.io](https://htmlreference.io) choose a few interesting HTML tags, and see how they work.

### Explore CSS
Spend some time reviewing your favorite websites - what are your most delightful items? What CSS is being used to do it? Check out [CSSreference.io](https://CSSreference.io) to see what properties exist and how they work.

### Run a python webserver
From the command line, in the same directory that your `index.html` file lives in, run `python -m http.server`. This will run the python http server module from the command line, and if you go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) you will see your index.html website!

Put `index.css` and other files your html page may fetch in the same directory.

### Choose your Top Ten!
Using the `index.html` and `style.css` files, build a one-page site that showcases your ten favorite/most intriguing HTML tags or CSS properties. Think through the following questions as you are creating your site:
- How do each HTML and CSS tag work?
